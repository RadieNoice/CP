# 11. Container With Most Water

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.


## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Loop Logic, Logic Error, Conditional Logic

1. **Key Issues**: Attempt 1 and 2 are missing the `while` loop body. The `area` calculation and pointer updates (`i++`, `j--`) were outside the loop, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Evolution**: No actual evolution occurred as both attempts had the same fundamental logic error.  The code was incomplete.
