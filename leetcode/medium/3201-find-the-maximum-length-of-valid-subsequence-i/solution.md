# 3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-i/

You are given an integer array nums. A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies: (sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2. Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Logic Error, Loop Logic, Conditional Logic

1. **Key Issues**: All attempts incorrectly calculate the longest valid subsequence.  `c` is undeclared and improperly placed. The logic for alternating even/odd sums is flawed; it doesn't check consecutive pairs' sums.  `f` is improperly toggled.

2. **Evolution**: Attempts 2 and 3 tried to fix the even/odd counting logic and variable placement but failed to address the core problem of checking consecutive pair sums.  The variable `c` remained undeclared within the loop's scope.
