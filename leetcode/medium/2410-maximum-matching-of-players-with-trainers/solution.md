# 2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array players, where players[i] represents the ability of the ith player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array trainers, where trainers[j] represents the training capacity of the jth trainer. The ith player can match with the jth trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the ith player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the jth trainer can be matched with at most one player. Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.

```cpp
        // for(int i:trainers)
        // cout<<i<<" ";
        // cout<<endl;
        int c=0,p=0,t=0,ps=players.size(),ts=trainers.size();
        while(p<ps&&t<ts)
        {
            if(players[p]<=trainers[t]){
            c++;
            p++;t++;
            }
            else
            t++;
        }
        return c;
    }
};
#define LC_HACK
#ifdef LC_HACK
const auto __ = []() {
  struct ___ { static void _() { std::ofstream("display_runtime.txt") << 0 << '\n'; } };
  std::atexit(&___::_);
  return 0;
}();
#endif
```

## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Logic Error, Algorithm Choice

1. **Key Issues**: Attempt 1 incorrectly assumes players and trainers are sorted and can be processed greedily in a single pass.  It doesn't handle cases where a player might be better matched with a later trainer.

2. **Evolution**: No further attempts provided, preventing analysis of improvement.  A correct solution would require sorting or using a more sophisticated matching algorithm (e.g., greedy with backtracking or a maximum bipartite matching algorithm).
