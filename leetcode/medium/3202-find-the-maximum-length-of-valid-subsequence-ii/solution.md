# 3202. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence II

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-ii/submissions/1701117108/

You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k. A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies: (sub[0] + sub[1]) % k == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % k == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % k. Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ans=0;
        vector<vector<int>>dp(k,vector<int>(k,0));
        for(int i:nums)
        {
        }
                dp[j][i]=dp[i][j]+1;
            
            for(int j=0;j<k;j++){
            i%=k;
    }
        return ans;
            }
                ans= max(ans,dp[j][i]);
};
```

## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Logic Error, Algorithm Choice, Data Structure

1. **Key Issues**: Attempts 1-7 had numerous syntax errors and undefined variables (`l`).  Attempts 8-18 used an incorrect DP approach; the DP table dimensions and update logic are flawed.  The algorithm never correctly considered valid subsequences based on the modulo condition.

2. **Evolution**: Attempts improved syntax gradually, but the core logic remained incorrect. The shift to a `k x k` DP table in later attempts was a step towards a potentially correct structure, but the update rule was still faulty.  The code lacked the necessary logic to track valid subsequences.
